Visual Scene Classification is my BSc project. 
You can find the thesis here: https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:tuni-202108176578 

This repository contains all the code used in the thesis, written in Python. 
- resnet.py is the code used for training the pretrained Resnet model for new data.
- vgg.py is for training the pretrained VGG model and it is for most part identical to the resnet.
- test_model.py is for evaluating the trained model
